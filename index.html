<h1>Hello world</h1>

<p>Deployments so easy it's almost magical</p>

<h2>Conjure-up is a power tool for getting started with big software</h2>

<p>Conjure-up lets you summon up a big-software stack as a &ldquo;spell&rdquo; - a model of the stack, combined with extra know-how to get you from an installed stack to a fully usable one. Start using your big software instead of learning how to deploy it.</p>
